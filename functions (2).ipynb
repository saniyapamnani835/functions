        "# Q1 what is python and why is it popular ?\n",
        "python is popular because it is a simple and easy to learn language. python language used english language like a syntax. python is easily understnad to beginners.python is a high level and interpreted language.\n",
        "# Q2 what is an interpreter in python ?\n",
        "a python interpreter is a program that directly executes python code. when you write the python script, the interpreter translates the human readable code.python intrpreter high level code to convert a easy code.\n",
        "# Q3 what are predefined keywords in python ?\n",
        "if,for,def,class,True,False,None\n",
        "Q4 can keywords be used as variable names ?\n",
        "No ,keywords are the reserved words cannot be used as variable names. because they have a special ,predefined meaning in a programming language.\n",
        "# Q5 what is mutability in python ?\n",
        " mutability refers to whether an object's state or value can be changed after it has been created.\n",
        " ex of mutable types in python include: lists, dictionaries, sets , user-defined classes.\n",
        " Q6 why are lists mutable ,but tuples are immutable ?\n",
        " mutable objects modified without creating a new object.\n",
        " lists : you can add, remove ,or change the elements within a list.\n",
        " immutable objects if you need a modify a object then you create a new object .\n",
        " tuples : once created ,elements within a tuple cannot be changed.\n",
        " Q7 what is the differnce between \"==\"    and    \"is\" operators in python ?\n",
        "1 feature        \"==\"(equality operator)          \"is\"(identify operator)\n",
        " 2 purpose         compare values                   compares object identify\n",

        " Q8. what are logical operators in pyhton ?\n",
        " logical operators in python ae used to combine conditional statements and perform logical operations on bollean values(True or False).\n",
        " Python has three primary logical operators :  1 and operators(conjuction) 2 or operator (disjunction)  3 not operator (negation).\n",
        " Q9.  what is type casting in python ?\n",
        " Type casting in python , also known as type conversion , is the process of converting a value from one data type to another.there are two types of type casting -\n",
        " 1. implict Typecasting  (int(), float(), str(), list(), Tuple(),set(), dict(), bool())\n",
        " 2.explicit typecasting\n",
        " Q 10. what is the differnce between implict and explicit type casting ?\n",
        "  implict Tc                               explicit TC\n",
        " 1 coercion                               conversion\n",
        " 2 automatic by python                       manual, by the\n",
        "    interpreter                              programmer\n",

        " 5  NO syntax required                      uses functions like int(), str (),\n",
        " Q 11. what is the purpose of conditional statements in python ?\n",
        " The purpose of conditional statements in python is to control the flow of program based on a specific conditions.conditional statements are if, if-else,elif,nested if-else statement.\n",
        " Q 12. How does the elif statement work ?\n",
        "  elif statements : if the conditon is false ,the interpreter moves to the first elif statement and  evaluates its condition .\n",
        "  if the elif condition is True ,then code block is executed ,and the elif condition is false , the interpreter proceed to the next statement.\n",
        "  Q13. what is the differnce between for and while loops ?\n",
        "  for loop used when the number of iterations is known or when iterating over a sequence (like a list,tuple,string or range).it iterates through each time in the sequence.\n",
        "  while loop used when the number of iterations is unknown and depends on a condition being met.it is executed as long as a specified condition is true.\n",
        "  Q14. describe the scenario where a while loop is more suitablethan a for loop ?\n",
        "A while loop is more suitable than a for loop in scenarios where the number of iterations is not known in advance and depends on a specific condition being met.\n",
